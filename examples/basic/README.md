react-easy-transition basic example
===================================

In components/App.js, we wrap props.children in an ```jsx
<EasyTransition>
``` tag. That's it.

Demo : http://misterfresh.github.io/react-easy-transition

Based on react-router-redux basic example. 

This is a basic example that demonstrates rendering components based
on URLs with `react-router` as well as connecting them to Redux state.
It uses both <Link> elements as well as the `push` action creator
provided by react-router-redux.

This example also demonstrates integration with
**[redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) ^3.0.0**

**To run, follow these steps:**

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` in this directory (make sure it creates a local node_modules)
2. Start build with `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
